# Blood-bank-management-system
This Blood Bank Management System in C++ acts as a helping hand for blood bank and hospitals to manage the supply of blood packets and maintain the data of the users who donate blood and even the one who takes blood from the blood banks. It is a fast and static C++ application that reduces manpower and creates a stable workflow.
